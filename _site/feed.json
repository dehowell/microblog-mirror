			"content_html": "<p>What Nick Heer dubs <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/\">“The Bullshit Web”</a> is already intolerable on carefullly-managed, developer class hardware. The web is barely functional on low-end machines. Try going to Staples and browsing the Dell website on a $300 laptop – it’s eye-opening.</p>\n\n<p>Some machines in that price class are better and <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-laptop-under-500/\">the savvy consumer can do alright with the Wirecutter’s help</a>. But it’s not uncommon for manufacturer’s to skimp on CPU and RAM in favor of irrelevant bells and whistles and I wouldn’t trust the sales staff at a big box retailer to steer a shopper in that right direction.</p>\n\n<p>The financial and technical bottleneck to having a good experience online is so much worse than you think. At least the websites for government agencies are stuck in fifteen-year old designs that will function well on cheap hardware.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a software developer and want your work to be an empowering and democratizing force, you need to be excellent on uncool hardware.</p>\n\n",
