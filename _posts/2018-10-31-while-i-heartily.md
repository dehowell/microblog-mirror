While I heartily endorse the (apparently) radical proposition that a business should focus its effort on _earning profit directly from its product_ rather than from vague gambles on side-effects of future adoption, the [Zebras Unite manifesto][1] leaves me wondering where are the "zebra" companies they are contrasting to venture capital driven unicorns?

Of course, I can think of lots of candidates (Basecamp, of course), but I'm surprised that the Zebras Unite website doesn't have a list of _examples_.
