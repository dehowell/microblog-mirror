An ["echo chamber" forms from weaponizing _ad hominem_ attacks](https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-as-hard-to-escape-an-echo-chamber-as-it-is-to-flee-a-cult), as opposed to the selection bias that leads to filter bubbles. I would love to see Nicky Case's simulation of [knowledge transmission through crowds]([http://ncase.me/crowds/]) extended to model trained distrust and the rebound effects.
