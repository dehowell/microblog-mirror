Two articles I read today have me thinking about how a 9-5 job disrupts valuable human rhythms:

- No Tech Magazine [describes tending to fermentation projects](http://www.notechmagazine.com/2018/07/fermentation-and-daily-life.html) in the kitchen as you pass through.
- The New York Times covers [timing meals with your circadian rhythm, in an 8-10 hours window.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/well/when-we-eat-or-dont-eat-may-be-critical-for-health.html)
