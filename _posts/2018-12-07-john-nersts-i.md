John Nerst's ["I, LPC"](https://everythingstudies.com/2018/12/06/i-lpc/) describes how it's perfectly possible to be simultaneously a liberal, a progressive, and a conservative. The key is to look past where each stance is typically found with the coalitions of a polity and focus instead on their motivating values.

I usually find "centrist" and "moderate" frustrating as political labels. It seems like a cop-out to just say "I think everyone has good ideas!" I don't think everyone has good _ideas_. But I do think everyone probably has _values_ that I can learn from. A centrism of values, that considers trade-offs between them situation by situation, rather than a centrism of policies... that's a centrism I could endorse.

As John Nerst describes the liberal, progressive, conservative stance:

> It views society as a system thatâ€™s evolved in interaction with physical, economic and biological limiting factors. The system needs to be protected, but at the same time be given enough space improve towards the goal of enabling human thriving and flourishing according to whatever standard for thriving and flourishing each person prefers.
