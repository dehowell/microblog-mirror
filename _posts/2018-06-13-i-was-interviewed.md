I was interviewed for (but not quoted in) a [WSJ article about people who strive to maintain daily meditation streaks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stressed-type-as-are-turning-meditation-into-a-competitive-sport-1528814126). I don't fit the narrative of "nerds missing the point of meditation", so I'm pleased to have been left out.
