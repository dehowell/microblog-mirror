I love Julia Evans' 2018 Deconstruct talk ["build impossible programs"](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/julia-evans-build-impossible-programs), where she tells the story of carving out time to build her Ruby profiler -- despite lacking experience in Ruby internals, systems programming, and not working on nights and weekends. Along the way, she learned how to code in Rust, how to compile and unit test against a wide variety of Ruby versions, and how to carve out time for ambitious work using sabbaticals and fellowships. 

Julia is one of my heroes, for her tremendous enthusiasm and gumption. She tackles hard problems in a spirit of chaotic fun and turns her learning into art and inspiration for others.
