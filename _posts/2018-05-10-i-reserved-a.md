I reserved a username with the [Eco currency](https://eco.com) today. After reading the [design proposal](https://eco.com/eco-design-proposal-v1.pdf), it seems like the first cryptocurrency open to the existing value in institutional trust. It probably looks like a waste of time to purists -- and that is why I'm interested.
