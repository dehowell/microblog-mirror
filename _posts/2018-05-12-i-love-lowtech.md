I love Low-Tech Magazine for looking at technologies [not in terms of efficiency](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/01/bedazzled-by-energy-efficiency.html), but in terms of the _services_ the technologies provide. "Efficient" implies only one direction for progress, but there are also gains in [giving up net-harmful services](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/can-the-internet-run-on-renewable-energy.html).
